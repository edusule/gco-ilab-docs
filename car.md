Coverage Details:
The insurance is designed to meet the requirements for compulsory motor vehicle insurance, allowing customers to select from basic to comprehensive policies. The options extend to cover various needs of the vehicle, the driver, and any occupants. Main coverages include third-party damages, public liability, legal defense, claims for damages, and services like telephone legal and medical advice. Additionally, it covers vehicle-specific risks such as breakage of glass, fire, theft, and collision damage.

Exclusions:
The policy generally does not cover damages intentionally caused by the insured party, accidents under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and use of the vehicle without a valid driving license. It also excludes damages incurred during unauthorized transport conditions, participation in competitive events, and mechanical breakdowns. Certain damages are also covered by the Insurance Compensation Consortium instead.

Restrictions:
Post-payment of compensation for compulsory civil liability, the insurer may reclaim from those responsible for damages caused by malicious conduct or impaired driving. Coverage restrictions apply, particularly when the vehicle is driven without a license. A total loss is considered when repair costs exceed 80% of the payable compensation.

Geographical Scope:
The insurance coverage is valid throughout the European Economic Area and associated states including Andorra, Serbia, and Switzerland, although some guarantees may vary territorially.

Policyholder Obligations:
Policyholders are required to provide accurate information at the inception of the policy and inform the insurer of any risk changes promptly. Payments must be made according to the agreed schedule, and in the event of an accident, the insurer must be notified within 7 days with all relevant details provided.

Payment Details:
Payments can be made via direct debit, credit, or debit card when the insurance is taken out or at the renewal start date.

Coverage Duration:
Coverage starts once the first payment is made and ends according to the dates specified in the contract.
